        <h1>Hello World Wide Web</h1>
        <p>This webpage is hosted on a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. It's only purpose is to use it as the showcase for the underlying infrastructure, rather than being the main focus itself</p>
		<p>The code for this site is hosted on GitHub, and every new commit triggers a Jenkins pipeline, which in turn rolls out an updated containerized application.</p>
		<p>The cluster's case is 3D-printed. I downloaded the design from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3349047" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>.</p>
        <p>This Raspberry Pi setup includes two units with 4 GB of RAM each, and a third unit equipped with 8 GB of RAM. This configuration provides a robust foundation for the cluster.</p>
        <p>This is just the start. I am in the process of developing a comprehensive home lab. The future setup will include a network switch, access points, a patch panel, NAS, and an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), all organized within a 19" rack. This small project reflects my passion for technology and continuous learning.</p>
